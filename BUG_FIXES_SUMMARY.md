## 🤖 Gemini AI Chat Fixes

### Critical Bug Fixes:

#### 1. Backend Integration Issues
**Problem**: The main.py backend was not passing `style` and `language` parameters to the Gemini API.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before: Missing style and language extraction
body = await request.json()
message = body.get("message")
chat_id = body.get("chat_id", "default")

# After: Proper parameter extraction and passing
body = await request.json()
message = body.get("message")
chat_id = body.get("chat_id", "default")
style = body.get("style", "auto")
language = body.get("language", "en")

# Pass to Gemini function
reply = get_gemini_reply(prompt_parts, style=style, language=language)
```

#### 2. Prompt Construction Issues
**Problem**: The Gemini API was receiving an array instead of a properly formatted string prompt.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before: Array format that could cause issues
full_prompt = [system_prompt, style_instruction, lang_instruction, user_prompt]

# After: Proper string formatting
full_prompt = f"""{system_prompt}

{style_instruction}

{lang_instruction}

{user_prompt}"""
```

#### 3. Language Instruction Enhancement
**Problem**: Generic language instructions weren't specific enough for proper language handling.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before: Basic language instructions
'hi': "Respond in Hindi."
'te': "Respond in Telugu."

# After: Enhanced with script and grammar instructions
'hi': "Respond in Hindi. Use Devanagari script and appropriate Hindi grammar."
'te': "Respond in Telugu. Use Telugu script and appropriate Telugu grammar."
```

#### 4. Frontend Abort Controller Issues
**Problem**: Race conditions and improper cleanup of HTTP requests.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Improved abort controller management
- ✅ Proper cleanup on component unmount
- ✅ Better error handling for cancelled requests
- ✅ Enhanced typing animation with safety checks

#### 5. Chat State Management
**Problem**: Edge cases in chat persistence and state management.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Improved error handling during message persistence
- ✅ Better cleanup of typing intervals
- ✅ Enhanced stop functionality
- ✅ More robust state management

## 🧪 Testing and Verification
